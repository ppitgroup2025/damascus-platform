    <!-- Preconnect for Google Fonts if needed, but original didn't use them explicitly in head, likely in css or just local fonts were intended but not linked properly in snippet. 
         Wait, I moved fonts folder. I should check how they were loaded. 
         Original style.css likely references them.
